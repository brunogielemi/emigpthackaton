- column: listing_candidate_id
  description: ID from the table `candidate.listing_candidates`. It's a unique ID
    to represent the combination candidate - listing. With the Reapplications feature,
    there is no longer a unique relation between those entities, so it should be deprecated
    when the migration to Candidate Funnel Instances is completed.

  type: integer
- column: candidate_id
  description: The ID of the candidate. Ideally, each `candidate` ID` represents one

    it does not exist in the context of screening conversations.
  type: integer
- column: n_candidate_id
  description: 'A composed identifier for candidates before Screening (where the Candidate
    ID is created). It''s created as follows: 1. First, if the candidate already has
    an ID, it''s equal to the Candidate ID. 2. Otherwise, if the Candidate Channel
    ID is already associated with a Candidate ID, we use that Candidate ID. 3. Finally,
    if we can''t associate a Candidate ID with the conversation we use a concatenation
    of `C` plus the Candidate Channel ID.'
